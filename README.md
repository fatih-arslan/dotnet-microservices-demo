This project was built as a learning exercise in microservices architecture with .NET. It showcases the development of multiple web APIs using ASP.NET Core to handle different functionalities. PostgreSQL and MongoDB databases are used to manage various data requirements. Communication between services is facilitated through RabbitMQ, Mass Transit, and gRPC, ensuring efficient data exchange. Authentication is implemented via IdentityServer, and SignalR is used for real-time notifications. Dockerization enables straightforward deployment and scalability, while YARP effectively manages incoming requests.
